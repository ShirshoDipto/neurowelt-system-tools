# Execution Testing

Available testing scripts:
* [`error_process.sh`](./error_process.sh) - Simple scripts running a loop with error-generating commands until it randomly exits with success
* [`error_process.py`](./error_process.py) - Alternative to the above script written in Python, but with some glitter on top
